Notes:

  * For security reasons direct browsing of windows shares only works in Microsoft Internet Explorer per default (and only in the "local zone").
  * For Mozilla and Firefox it can be enabled through different workaround mentioned in the [[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Links_to_local_pages_do_not_work|Mozilla Knowledge Base]]. However, there will still be a JavaScript warning about trying to open a Windows Share. To remove this warning (for all users), put the following line in ''conf/lang/en/lang.php'' (more details at [[doku>localization#changing_some_localized_texts_and_strings_in_your_installation|localization]]): <code - conf/lang/en/lang.php>
<?php
/**
 * Customization of the english language file
 * Copy only the strings that needs to be modified
 */
$lang['js']['nosmblinks'] = '';
</code>
